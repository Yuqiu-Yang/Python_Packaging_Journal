Python Packaging Journal
=================================================

Nowadays, Python has almost become an ubiquitous programming language. People from various 
backgrounds utilize Python to create all kinds tools to facilitate their jobs or simply for fun. 
Although Python is itself a simple language, organizing Python code or creating a Python-based 
package could be a bit overwhelming for newcomers including myself (what's a license, why do we use conda,
 what is PyPI, what are all those weird configuration files, etc.). 

Being an absolute novice myself, I myself am still exploring this vast and fast-evolving field. 
However, during this process, I find it extremely helpful to jot down what I learned so far for future reference. 
This can serve as a knowledge base.
